Task: Make Topologies Using OSPF and EIGRP. Do IP allocation using DHCP. Configure DNS.

### OSPF
Open Shortest Path First is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol networks. It uses a link state routing algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols, operating within a single autonomous system. It is defined as OSPF Version 2 in RFC 2328 for IPv4.

### EIGRP 
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol that is used on a computer network for automating routing decisions and configuration. The protocol was designed by Cisco Systems as a proprietary protocol, available only on Cisco routers.

### Redistribution
Redistribution is a process which allows exchanging routing information between different routing processes or from static information to routing process. Redistribution is configured on border routers which have more than one routing process enabled.
